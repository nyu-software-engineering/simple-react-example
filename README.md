# Example from 2 March 2022

A simple React example showing:

- Components (a.k.a functions that return modular, reusable parts of the interface)
- `JSX` (a.k.a HTML-like syntax for creating interface elements)
- Event handlers (a.k.a functions you can run when the user clicks something, types something, or submits a form)
- Props (a.k.a. arguments to components)
- State variables
- Side-Effects (a.k.a. functions that can be run whenever a component first loads or anytime a State variable changes its value.)
- Using `axios` to make requests to servers.
